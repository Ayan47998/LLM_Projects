I have created a system that evaluates resumes against job descriptions using a large language model and natural language processing techniques. Hereâ€™s a summary of your project that you might find useful:

Project Overview: ATS-like Resume Evaluation System
Description
You developed a model that simulates an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) for Data Scientist and AI/ML roles. The system takes job descriptions as input and evaluates user resumes, providing a matching score in percentage.

Key Components
Model: Google Gemini Pro, utilized as the underlying Generative AI model to assess resume-job description compatibility.
PDF Processing: Used the pypdf library to convert resumes from PDF format to text, enabling analysis.
Frontend: Implemented using Streamlit, allowing users to easily upload their resumes and job descriptions, and view results.
Workflow
Input: Users provide a job description and upload their resume in PDF format.
Processing: The system converts the PDF resume to text and analyzes it against the job description.
Evaluation: Using the LLM, the system calculates a matching score based on keywords, skills, and experience relevant to the job description.
Output: The user receives a percentage score indicating how well their resume matches the job description.
Technologies Used
Google Gemini Pro: For advanced natural language understanding.
pypdf: For PDF to text conversion.
Streamlit: For creating an interactive web application interface.
Future Improvements
Incorporate more sophisticated scoring algorithms.
Add features like keyword suggestions or tips for resume improvement.
Expand to support other roles and industries.
